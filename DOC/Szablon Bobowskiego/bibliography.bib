abstract="It is shown how to distribute a secret to n persons such that each person can verify that he has received correct information about the secret without talking with other persons. Any k of these persons can later find the secret (1 ≤ k ≤ n), whereas fewer than k persons get no (Shannon) information about the secret. The information rate of the scheme is 1/2 and the distribution as well as the verification requires approximately 2k modular multiplications pr. bit of the secret. It is also shown how a number of persons can choose a secret ``in the well'' and distribute it verifiably among themselves.",

abstract="This paper presents a three-move interactive identification scheme and proves it to be as secure as the discrete logarithm problem. This provably secure scheme is almost as efficient as the Schnorr identification scheme, while the Schnorr scheme is not provably secure. This paper also presents another practical identification scheme which is proven to be as secure as the factoring problem and is almost as efficient as the Guillou-Quisquater identification scheme: the Guillou-Quisquater scheme is not provably secure. We also propose practical digital signature schemes based on these identification schemes. The signature schemes are almost as efficient as the Schnorr and Guillou-Quisquater signature schemes, while the security assumptions of our signature schemes are weaker than those of the Schnorr and Guillou-Quisquater. signature schemes. This paper also gives a theoretically generalized result: a three-move identification scheme can be constructed which is as secure as the random-self-reducible problem. Moreover, this paper proposes a variant which is proven to be as secure as the difficulty of solving both the discrete logarithm problem and the specific factoring problem simultaneously. Some other variants such as an identity-based variant and an elliptic curve variant are also proposed.",

abstract="We propose a new and efficient signature scheme that is provably secure in the plain model. The security of our scheme is based on a discrete-logarithm-based assumption put forth by Lysyanskaya, Rivest, Sahai, and Wolf (LRSW) who also showed that it holds for generic groups and is independent of the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. We prove security of our scheme under the LRSW assumption for groups with bilinear maps. We then show how our scheme can be used to construct efficient anonymous credential systems as well as group signature and identity escrow schemes. To this end, we provide efficient protocols that allow one to prove in zero-knowledge the knowledge of a signature on a committed (or encrypted) message and to obtain a signature on a committed message.",

abstract="Pseudonym systems allow users to interact with multiple organizations anonymously, using pseudonyms. The pseudonyms cannot be linked, but are formed in such a way that a user can prove to one organization a statement about his relationship with another. Such a statement is called a credential. Previous work in this area did not protect the system against dishonest users who collectively use their pseudonyms and credentials, i.e., share an identity. Previous practical schemes also relied very heavily on the involvement of a trusted center. In the present paper we give a formal definition of pseudonym systems where users are motivated not to share their identity, and in which the trusted center's involvement is minimal. We give theoretical constructions for such systems based on any one-way function. We also suggest an efficient and easy-to-implement practical scheme.",

abstract="Digital signature schemes are a fundamental cryptographic primitive, of use both in its own right, and as a building block i n cryptographic protocol design. In this paper, we propose a practical and provably secure signature scheme and show protocols (1) for issuing a signature on a committed value (so the signer has no information about the signed value), and (2) for proving knowledge of a signature on a committed value. This signature scheme and corresponding protocols are a building block for the design of anonymity-enhancing cryptographic systems, such as electronic cash, group signatures, and anonymous credential systems. The security of our signature scheme and protocols relies on the Strong RSA assumption. These results are a generalization of the anonymous credential system of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya.",

A key idea is to use for the base of the discrete logarithm an integer $\alpha$ in ℤ                  p                 such that the order of $\alpha$ is a sufficiently large prime q, e.g., q ≥ 2140.

We present an efficient algorithm that preprocesses the exponentiation of a random residue modulo p.",

abstract="A group signature scheme allows members of a group to sign messages on the group's behalf such that the resulting signature does not reveal their identity. Only a designated group manager is able to identify the group member who issued a given signature. Previously proposed realizations of group signature schemes have the undesirable property that the length of the public key is linear in the size of the group. In this paper we propose the first group signature scheme whose public key and signatures have length independent of the number of group members and which can therefore also be used for large groups. Furthermore, the scheme allows the group manager to add new members to the group without modifying the public key. The realization is based on methods for proving the knowledge of signatures.",
